~~My config files - primarily spacemacs init and private layers~~

2020 most recent config is in [this semi-literate config](./configuration.org)
Highlights of my emacs config recently are use of an org file again, after
coming out of Spacemacs. straight.el is my package manager. xah-fly-keys
drives the interface. i do ruby mostly at work, so i have some config to make
that nicer.

Spacemacs files exist for historical reference, it is unlikely i'll go back
at this point :)
